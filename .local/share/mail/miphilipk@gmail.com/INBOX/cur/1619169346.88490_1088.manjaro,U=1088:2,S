Hello and welcome to XDA! This site will let you get more from your phone whether you are here to find a custom ROM, learn how to root, or just make some friends.

You might have noticed that we have a lot of ads on every page of the site. They're annoying, and they slow down the site, and for that we apologize. They're a necessary evil that helps fund the many costs associated with running this site, such as multiple full time employees, 15+ servers, well over 100TB of bandwidth, and more.

Of course, you can use an ad-blocker. It's your right as a citizen of the internet to do so, and we can't stop you, but blocking ads doesn't help XDA. 

If you want to know how you can support XDA, you can consider purchasing an ad-free subscription to our site which gives you access to our speedy ad-free template. Doing so also gives you a special badge that lets everyone on XDA know that you're a supporter. Here's how to sign up:

https://forum.xda-developers.com/ad-free/

Don't worry, we won't bother you about this again. Otherwise, we hope you enjoy your stay on XDA, and thank you for joining our community! :)

- svetius
