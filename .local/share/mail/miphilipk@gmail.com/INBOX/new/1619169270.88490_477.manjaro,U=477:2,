You've received this email because you have a consumer (personal) Google+  
account or you manage a Google+ page.

In December 2018, we announced(Link  
https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/expediting-changes-google-plus/)  
our decision to shut down Google+ for consumers in April 2019 due to low  
usage and challenges involved in maintaining a successful product that  
meets consumers' expectations. We want to thank you for being part of  
Google+ and provide next steps, including how to download your photos and  
other content.

On April 2nd, your Google+ account and any Google+ pages you created will  
be shut down and we will begin deleting content from consumer Google+  
accounts. Photos and videos from Google+ in your Album Archive and your  
Google+ pages will also be deleted. You can download and save(Link  
https://support.google.com/plus/answer/1045788) your content, just make  
sure to do so before April. Note that photos and videos backed up in Google  
Photos will not be deleted.

The process of deleting content from consumer Google+ accounts, Google+  
Pages, and Album Archive will take a few months, and content may remain  
through this time. For example, users may still see parts of their Google+  
account via activity log and some consumer Google+ content may remain  
visible to G Suite users until consumer Google+ is deleted.

As early as February 4th, you will no longer be able to create new Google+  
profiles, pages, communities or events.

See the full FAQ(Link https://support.google.com/plus/answer/9217723) for  
more details and updates leading up to the shutdown.

If you're a Google+ Community owner or moderator, you may download and  
save(Link https://support.google.com/plus/answer/1045788) your data for  
your Google+ Community. Starting early March 2019, additional data will be  
available for download, including author, body, and photos for every  
community post in a public community. Learn more (Link  
https://support.google.com/plus/answer/1045788#communities)

If you sign in to sites and apps using the Google+ Sign-in button, these  
buttons will stop working in the coming weeks but in some cases may be  
replaced by a Google Sign-in button. You'll still be able to sign in with  
your Google Account wherever you see Google Sign-in buttons. Learn more  
(Link https://support.google.com/plus/answer/9217723#signin?)

If you've used Google+ for comments on your own or other sites, this  
feature will be removed from Blogger by February 4th and other sites by  
March 7th. All your Google+ comments on all sites will be deleted starting  
April 2, 2019. Learn more(Link  
https://support.google.com/plus/answer/9217723#blogger)

If you're a G Suite customer, Google+ for your G Suite account should  
remain active. Contact your G Suite administrator(Link  
https://support.google.com/a/answer/6208960) for more details. You can also  
expect a new look and new features soon. Learn more(Link  
https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/new-enterprise-grade-features-in-googleplus-help-businesses-drive-collaboration)

If you're a developer using Google+ APIs or Google+ Sign-in, click  
here(Link https://developers.google.com/+/api-shutdown) to see how this  
will impact you.

 From all of us on the Google+ team, thank you for making Google+ such a  
special place. We are grateful for the talented group of artists, community  
builders, and thought leaders who made Google+ their home. It would not  
have been the same without your passion and dedication.
